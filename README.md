# Memoria: Headless AI Memory & Context Server

**Powered by 371-OS & CORTEX Amplifier**

Memoria is a drop-in "Memory-as-a-Service" API designed to solve the hardest part of building AI applications: memory management and context retention. 

## 🧠 Cognitive Optimization Overview

Memoria accelerates pattern recognition and hyper-focus channeling by offloading context management from the developer to an autonomous system. It provides episodic memory for AI agents, allowing them to maintain context across sessions seamlessly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Zero-Setup Vector Store:** Send text, and we automatically embed and store it using Google Gemini Embeddings (`gemini-embedding-2-preview`).
- **Frictionless Storage:** Memories are stored locally in a persistent `data/memories.json` file by default. 
- **Enterprise Scale with ClickHouse:** Instantly scale to billions of vectors by providing a `CLICKHOUSE_HOST`. Memoria automatically switches from local JSON to ClickHouse for high-performance vector search.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server:** Fully compatible with Claude Desktop and Cursor via the included MCP Server.
- **Semantic Retrieval:** Query by meaning, not just keywords.
- **User Segregation & Security:** Strict partitioning by `userId` and secured via `MEMORIA_API_KEY` authentication.

## 🐳 1-Click Deployment (Docker & Akash)

Memoria is designed for frictionless deployment on decentralized and traditional clouds.

### Docker Compose
Run Memoria and ClickHouse locally with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Akash Network (Decentralized Cloud)
Deploy to the Akash Network using the included `akash.yml` Stack Definition Language (SDL) file. This provisions both the Memoria API and a ClickHouse database on decentralized compute.

## 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Memoria includes a built-in MCP server, allowing you to instantly give AI assistants (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) long-term memory.

### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
npm run mcp
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memoria": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/memoria/mcp-server.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, Claude will automatically have access to two new tools:
- `store_memory(userId, text)`
- `retrieve_context(userId, query, topK)`

## 💻 API Documentation

### 1. Store Memory
`POST /api/memory/[userId]`

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.memoria.ai/v1/memory/user_123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I am allergic to peanuts"}'
```

### 2. Retrieve Context
`GET /api/memory/[userId]/context?query=[your_query]&topK=3`

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.memoria.ai/v1/memory/user_123/context?query=recipe_recommendations"
```
